## Instructions
Using the terminal you...
- Should create a new .NET project using the `webapi` template titled "MyFirstLesson".

Additional Information:
- The new .NET project will need to be located in the root of this GitHub Repository
    - If you are using codespaces, this will mean within the directory `/workspaces/km__advanced-c-sharp__001-first-api-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME`
    - Otherwise, it will depend on where you have cloned this repo. It should be within the same directory as this `README.md` file.
- You should NOT change any code within the `TestsProj` directory

Troubleshooting:
- If during the course of completing this assignment, you receive `error NU1101` or `error NU1102`, you may to configure NuGet for your development enviornment. You can fix these errors and complete the assignment by running the command `dotnet nuget add source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --name nuget.org` in your terminal.
